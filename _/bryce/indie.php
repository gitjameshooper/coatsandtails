<p class="h1">Poster Design for a Battle-of-the-Bands Event</p>
<p class="body">I moved to Baton Rouge when I was 27. I lived there for a year. During that time, I started exploring art, illustration, and graphic design. I basically didn't know exactly what sort of stuff I wanted to make; I only knew that I wanted to make stuff. So when <i>Dig</i> magazine posted a call for artists, I submitted my paltry portfolio, and surprisingly I was asked to create the poster art for a battle-of-the-bands event. As a newcomer, I was pretty excited about the project, and made the poster shown below. </p>
