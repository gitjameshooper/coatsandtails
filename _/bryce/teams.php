<p class="h1">Marketing Folder </p>
<p class="body">Prologic was the first company I worked for out of college. I was hired as a technical writer, but I was also responsible for whatever graphic design projects came up. As I became more proficient in Adobe Creative Suite, I became more and more of a graphic designer, creating an array of marketing collateral that helped solidify the company's message and visually represent each product.</p>
<p class="body">Probably one of my biggest challenges at Prologic was to create and solidify the company's identity using icons and consistent design standards. Before I started working at Prologic, there was no consistent branding, and I wanted to create that standard.  </p>
<p class="body">Below is a marketing folder that is the culmination of that rewiring. After discussing the philosophy and messages the company wanted to communicate, I created icons and images that I hoped people would begin to associate with each product offering. I also interviewed the most knowledgeable SMEs in each quadrant of the company so I could create effective copy. </p>
<p class="body">Below is the folder that I wrote and designed that I think was successful in communicating the company's overall message.</p>
