            <td height="916" align="center" valign="top"><p class="about_me_text">Prologic was the first company I worked for out of college. I was hired as a technical writer, but I was also responsible for whatever graphic design projects came up. As I became more proficient in Adobe Creative Suite, I became more and more of a graphic designer, creating an array of marketing collateral that helped solidify the company's message and visually represent each product.</p>
              <p class="about_me_text">Probably one of my biggest challenges at Prologic was to create and  solidify the company's identity using icons and consistent design  standards. Before I started working at Prologic, there was no consistent  branding, and I wanted to create that standard.<br />
<br />
                Below is a marketing folder that is the culmination of that rewiring. After  discussing the philosophy and messages the company wanted to  communicate, I created icons and images that I hoped people would begin  to associate with each product offering. I also interviewed the most  knowledgeable SMEs in each quadrant of the company so I could create  effective copy. <br />
                <br />
                Below is the folder that I wrote and designed that I think was successful in communicating the company's overall message. </p>
