<p class="body">Below is a responsive website I designed. The site allows users to build their pet portraits by choosing clothes and accessories, uploading photos, selecting frames, and checking out. They can also take a pet personality test, which I wrote and designed. Finally, I also designed a merchandise section for tee shirts, prints, and other pet-related gear.</p>
