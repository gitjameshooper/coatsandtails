<p class="h1">Fundraiser for Coat & Tails</p>
<p class="body">Below is a campaign I designed for my side project, <a href="http://www.coatandtails.com" target="_blank">Coat & Tails.</a> Every month, I have a fundraiser for a local rescue group, so I developed a set of marketing materials to use for each month. The campaign needed a particular voice to separate it far enough from my normal work so that people wouldn't confuse it with other parts of my business, but close enough to my style so people would know it's an extension of Coat & Tails.</p>
<p class="body">So for this campaign, I named it something kind of ridiculous and silly (which is the voice I've given Coat & Tails) and used vintage, but purely hand-drawn, fonts, just like I do with other Coat & Tails materials.</p>
<p class="body">Because the campaign relied strongly on social media, below are images I made specifically for social networking sites.
